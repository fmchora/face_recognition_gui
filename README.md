# face_recognition
Uses libraries from the open source OpenCV to recognize and detect faces in real time from a video source. The project and the GUI were written in Python.

Requirements for compilation:
Install OpenCV libraries. Follow this link for more informatiom https://quangduytran.wordpress.com/2017/09/25/install-opencv3-on-ubuntu/
I used PyCharm to compiled it, but you can use any other IDE.
